* what is the difference between on-premise and on cloud? 
  * the main difference is the location, the On-Premise is installed and runs on the company's hardware and hosted locally, whereas the cloud software is stored and managed on the provider's servers and accessed by the user through the internet and web.
  
* search leh dayman el option value prefix should start from 10,000. 
    * this is mainly in the option set, An option set is a type of field that can be included in an entity. It defines a set of options. When an option set is displayed in a form it uses a drop-down list control. When displayed in Advanced Find it uses a picklist control. Sometimes option sets are called picklists by developers.
    * As of my last knowledge update in September 2021, Dynamics 365 doesn't have a specific requirement to start counting from 10000 when adding an option into the options set. The numbering convention is not enforced by the system but is often considered a best practice recommended by developers and consultants.

    * Starting option values from 10000 (or any other large number) allows room for inserting new options in between existing ones without the need to renumber all the subsequent options. For example, if you initially have options with values 10000, 10001, 10002, and you need to add a new option between 10001 and 10002, you can assign it the value 10001.5 or 10001.1 without disrupting the existing order. This practice helps maintain consistency and makes it easier to manage the options set in the long run, especially if you anticipate future changes or additions to the options.

    * Keep in mind that practices and conventions might vary depending on the organization and the specific Dynamics 365 implementation. Always follow the guidelines provided by your team or organization when working with Dynamics 365 to maintain consistency and avoid potential issues.

* read more about the managed and the unmanaged solution. 
  * before talking about the managed and the unmanaged, lets talk about the solution.
  * the solution mainly is how the customizers and developers authors, package and maintain units of software that extend the functionality of the system.

  *  any on-Premis application consists of two main parts, Microsoft Components (out of the box) and the custom components (external components).
  *  there are two main types of on-premis solutions which are:
     *  managed:
        *  it is a complete solution, that is intended to be distributed, and installed.
     * unmanaged:
        *  solution under development, or unintended to be distributed. 
     * when we complete an unmanaged solution, and intend to distribute it, we just export it and package it into managed solution. 
### types of solutions: 
* System solution:
  * they are the solution components already existing in the system (default components), and they define the default system behaviour. 
* Managed solutions:
  * they are installed on top of the system, and can modify any customizable solution components or add mode solutions components.

* Unmanaged solutions:
  * when a solution is unmanaged, then there are some operations that you can apply:
    * Add components 
    * Remove components. 
    * Delete components that are allow for deletion
    * Export and import these unmanaged solutions
    * export the solution as a managed one. 
  
* what is the difference between managed solution and managed properties.
  * The managed properties will take effect after you package the managed solution and install it in a different organization. After the managed solution is installed, the managed properties cannot be updated except by an update of the solution by the original publisher.

    * Entity ownership: -> men ely ye2dr eno ybos 3la el data bta3t el entity de.

    > the custom entities that you create, and most customizble system entites are either organization owned or user/team owned.
    * Activity entity:
      * An activity can be thought of as any action for which an entry can be made on a calendar. An activity has time dimensions (start time, stop time, due date, and duration) that help determine when the action occurred or will occur. Activities also contain data that helps determine what action the activity represents, for example, subject and description. An activity can be opened, canceled, or completed. The completed status of an activity will have several sub-status values associated with it to clarify the way that the activity was completed.
      * Activity entity can only be owned by user/team, they can not be owned to organization, and this make sense, because there can not be an activity that include the whole organization, instead, each activity corresponds to certain team or certain person. 
      * there are many system entities that represents activities such as: 
        * Appointment
        * Campaign response
        * Email
        * Fax
        * Letter
        * Phone call
        * and so on

  * Appers in global filter in interactive experience. 
    * to be able to check this we need to understand what does interactive experience means:
      * it is a one-stop workplace where you review your workload, and stop to take actions. 
      * The information in the interactive dashboard is shown in real time, coming from views and queues. The interactive dashboards with their modern and intuitive interface are optimized for the customer service experience. For example, instead of paging through the application looking for a case, you’ll be able to open and update the case right from the dashboard. This will save you time, help to focus on tasks at hand, and get more work done. You’ll need sufficient permissions to use the interactive dashboards. The permissions will be assigned to you by an administrator.
      * there are many dashboards such as Tier1. 
      * they are like some statistical and graphical representations for the data to help you visualize your performance.
