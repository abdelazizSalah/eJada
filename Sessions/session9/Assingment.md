# Some other notes 
* when we create a new solution for ribbon, we do not include all the assets 
* that is because Add all aserts means that you took the entity and its views , charts , relationships,....  .you can choose this option only in case you want to move this entity to another environment
* You can choose option (include entity meta data) only without choosing any of forms or views or anything related to entity , that means you now treat with entity table itself
* And when you press ok, a warning message will appear to you informing you that there are some required components related to what you have choose and appear to you below , do you want to include them . But because we want what we choose only we say No
* It means that ribon workbench sees that there are some required component related to what you have choose and appear to you below , do you want ribon workbench to include them . But because we want what we choose only we say No
